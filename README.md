# Automatic Pet Door Prototype

## Project Overview

The prototype is designed to bring the convenience of automatic doors, which humans have enjoyed for decades, to our beloved pets. This project aims to improve the quality of life for pets by allowing them to enter and exit a space without requiring manual door operation.

## Features

- **Proximity Detection**: The door uses sensors to detect the proximity of a pet. When a pet approaches, the door automatically opens to let the pet in and closes after a certain period.
- **Human Distinction**: An additional sensor facing the top distinguishes between humans and pets. If both sensors detect an object, the door assumes it is a human (since a human's body would cover both sensors) and will not open.

## How It Works

1. **Proximity Sensor**: Detects when a pet is near the door.
2. **Automatic Door Operation**: Opens the door for the pet and closes it after a predetermined time.
3. **Human Detection**: An extra sensor at the top checks for human presence. If both the proximity sensor and the top sensor detect an object, the door remains closed, assuming it is a human.

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Sensors**: Proximity sensor and additional human detection sensor
